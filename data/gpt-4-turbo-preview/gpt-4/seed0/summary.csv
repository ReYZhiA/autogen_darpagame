9,alpha,Given the current state and the tools at Player Alpha's disposal; the next logical step would be to coordinate with a teammate who has the necessary tools to continue defusing Bomb 5. However; since direct coordination or communication with teammates is not an option in this format; and Player Alpha does not possess the Blue Tool required for the next step in the bomb's sequence; the best action for Player Alpha would be to move to a room where another bomb might be located or where they can be more effective. Since the locations and statuses of other bombs are currently unknown or not provided in the latest update; a strategic move would be to go back to Room 0; which connects to multiple rooms; offering flexibility for the next move.Action selection: Move to Room 0.,go to node 0,,Your observation is: Round: 9.

10,alpha,Given the current situation and the tools available to Player Alpha; and considering that Player Bravo; who has the green and blue wire cutters; is now in the same room (Room 0); the most strategic move for Player Alpha would be to either assist in finding another bomb that matches their toolset or to move to a room where they can be more effective.
